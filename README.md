# About me
I have started studying Javascript and programming at **Mittuniversitetet Sundsvall.** 
I live in Gothenburg with two cats, my boyfriend, family and friends. 

During my spare time I enjoy exercising, travelling, playing with my cats and spending time with people I love.
I want to learn Danish as I enjoy learning languages.
